# STOCK-RETURN-PREDICTION-VIA-MACHINE-LEARNING

This is the final project for 2021-2022 spring term Applied Statistics course. This project uses a series of machine learning methods to conduct stock return prediction. The data sets are available from [CRSP](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) and [Dacheng Xiu's Web Site](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/).
