# STOCK-RETURN-PREDICTION-VIA-MACHINE-LEARNING

This is the final project for 2021-2022 spring term Applied Statistics course. This project uses a series of machine learning methods to conduct stock return prediction. The data sets are available from [CRSP](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) and [Dacheng Xiu's Web Site](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/).

## Introduction

* `final report` and `final presentation`: include details of this project
* `data`: due to the limitation of data volume, the uploaded data only contains the information of 1000 randomly selected data for browsing 
* `codes`: include implementation of this project
  * `train_nn.py`: define the neural network structure and train the nn model
  * `prediction.py`: include all methods we need to compare
  * `exper.py`: use the certain data to conduct the prediction task
  * `new_tree.py`:  will be uploaded later
  * `plot_results.py`: draw the comparison of rmse among all the methods
* `results`: include the results from 2016 to 2020

## Implementation

* python exper.py
* If you want to compare other methods, you can add corresponding codes in `prediction.py`.
